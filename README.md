About
=====

The purpose of this paper is to introduce the reader to the very useful subject of fractals. We will focus on the Mandelbrot set and the related Julia sets. I will show some ways of visualising these sets and how to make a program that renders them. Finally, I will explain a key exchange algorithm based on what we have learnt.

Most of the grpahics in this paper was created using my Mandelbrot rendering program, which can be found in the ``code`` directory.
